    <p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored 
        cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey <br>
        after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
            <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil.
                 Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, <br>
                 or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, 
                 and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread <br>
                  in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, 
                  or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
